# Bench_Fan_Controller
Using a PWM PC fan, monitor and control the speed using an SSD1306 GLCD and a rotary encoder. Initial commit works fully on Arduino Uno. Future mods (should) include different display options, and a menu process to save and recall pre-set RPM values, and save them to EEPROM.

I used code and libraries from three online sources:

Adafruit - GFX & SSD1306 LCD driver, & fonts libraries

xxx - Encoder library

xxx - 25 KHz PWM direct from the 328's registers

xxx - Fan Controller to monitor the fan speed
